# Chemical Process Control Database

The Chemical Process Control Database is a web application created to provide detailed information about different chemical engineering reactors and processes. This project aims to serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and professionals in the field of chemical engineering, helping to alleviate the ennui often experienced when searching for critical information.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Database**: Contains detailed information about different types of reactors, including Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactors (CSTR), Plug Flow Reactors (PFR), Packed Bed Reactors (PBR), and Batch Reactors.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built using React for the frontend, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
- **RESTful API**: Powered by Django and Django REST Framework, allowing for easy retrieval and management of reactor data.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes D3.js for creating interactive charts and diagrams to visualize reactor performance and process flows.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Django: A high-level Python web framework.
  - Django REST Framework: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
  - PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

- **Frontend**:
  - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - D3.js: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.
  - Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

- **Deployment**:
  - Docker: For containerization and easy deployment.
  - Nginx: As a reverse proxy server.
